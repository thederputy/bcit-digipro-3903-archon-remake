Building

 This program was developed using C# with the .Net SDK and
the HTML Help SDK. To compile it, follow these steps.

  - open a command shell;
  - change the current dir to the src directory;
  - run the setenv.bat batch file. Please make sure that
  the paths are correct;
  - run 'nmake', or 'nmake nohelp' if you don' have the
  HTML Help compiler;
  - run 'nmake install' to install the program in the bin
  directory

 To build the HTML help file that is under the Help folder, you
need to have the HTML help compiler installed.
 If you wish to build the debug version, add a 'DEBUG=' in the
command line.

Running

  Just launch the executable, checkers.exe, located in the bin
 directory.
