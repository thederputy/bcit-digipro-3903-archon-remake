<h1>Crowning the Men</h1>
<ul>
  <li> When a man first reaches any of the squares on the opposite extreme line 
    of the board, it becomes a King, and must immediately be crowned (by placing 
    a man on top of it) by the opponent. Crowning a piece completes its move - 
    it cannot then capture a piece that is en prise.</li>
  <li> The King is empowered to move or capture backwards or forwards, as the 
    limits of the board permit. ( The King, like any man, may not refuse to capture 
    when the occasion arises.)</li>
  <li> If the opponent neglects to crown a man that has reached the King row, 
    and plays on, such play shall be put back until the man be crowned.</li>
</ul>
