    is strictly forbidden - such as making signs or sounds, pointing or hovering 
    over the board, unnecessarily delaying to move a piece touched, or smoking. 
    Any principal so acting, after having been warned of the consequence, &amp; 
    requested to desist, shall forfeit the game.</li>
  <li> While a game is pending, neither player is permitted to leave the room 
    without a sufficient reason, or receiving the other's consent or company.</li>
  <li> Any spectator giving warning, either by sign, sound, or remark, on any 
    of the games, whether played or pending, shall be ordered from the room during 
    the match, and play may be discontinued until such offending person retires.</li>
