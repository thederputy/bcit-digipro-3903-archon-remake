<h1>Moving and Attacking</h1>
<h2>Order of Play</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Each player shall play alternately with Black and White men, and lots shall 
    be cast for the colour only once - at the commencement of a match - the winner 
    to have the choice of taking Black or White.</li>
  <li> The first move is made by the player having the Black men, after which 
    the players move alternately.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method of Play</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The player whose turn it is to move proceeds by advancing one of his men 
    diagonally forward to an adjacent vacant square. If, however, an opponent's 
    piece occupies one of the adjacent squares, and there is a vacant square immediately 
    behind it, that piece of the opponent's is subject to capture, and must be 
    captured. The player does this by having his man leap over the opponent's 
    piece and on to the vacant square<br>
    (or any further similar squares) and then captures the piece (or pieces) by 
    removing it from the board. A player may not move a piece on to a square occupied 
    by an opponent's piece which does not have a vacant square immediately behind 
    it.</li>
  <li> Captures are compulsory, but if there is a choice of captures, the player 
    may choose that which best suits his purpose; he is not required to play the 
    move which captures the greatest number of men. However, once he begins a 
    capturing move he must continue until all the men available on the path chosen 
    have been captured.</li>
  <li> Uncrowned men may move or capture in a forward direction only.</li>
  <li> A capturing play, as well as an ordinary one, is completed whenever the 
    hand is withdrawn from the piece played, even though two or more pieces have 
    been taken, and have still to be removed from the board.</li>
  <li> When capturing, if a player removes one of his own pieces, he may not replace 
    it; but his opponent may either play or insist on his replacing it.</li>
</ul>
