<h1> Official Game Rules</h1>
<p> I thought that it would be a good idea to provide the official game rules 
  for checkers (draughts).</p>
<p>I have taken the liberty to use the rules that were described in the web site 
  <a href="http://www.centralconnector.com/GAMES/checkers.html">Game Cabinet</a>.</p>
<p>As stated on that web site, these rules were found on the help system of an 
  old MS-DOS checkers game.</p>
<p>Because of that, no page on this section has a copyright statement. The copyright 
  belongs to the original author that I failed to find.</p>
