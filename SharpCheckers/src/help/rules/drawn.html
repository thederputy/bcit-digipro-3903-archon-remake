<p> A draw results when neither of the players can force a win. When one of the 
  sides appears stronger than the other, the stronger party is required to complete 
  the win, or to show, to the satisfaction of the umpire or referee, at least 
  a decided advantage over his opponent within 40 of his own moves - to be counted 
  from the point at which notice was given - failing in which, he must relinquish 
  the game as a draw.</p>
