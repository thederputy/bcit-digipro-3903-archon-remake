<h1>The 'Huff' or 'Blow' </h1>
<ul>
  <li> If a player fails to capture one or more men that he should have taken, 
    his opponent, as penalty, may remove from the board the piece that should 
    have captured. This is called the 'Huff' or 'Blow', and does not constitute 
    a move.</li>
  <li> The player has the power to huff, or compel the capture, or let the piece 
    remain on the board, as he thinks best.</li>
</ul>
