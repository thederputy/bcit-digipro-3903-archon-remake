Dennis, since we last demoed this to you there have been few changes.

Changes implemented:

	1. User must now press 'E' after every phase to end their turn. Turns no longer end automatically after attacking.
	2. Using modification from change 1, attacks now work over networked games. 
		(two computers running Visual Studio 2010 and XNA 4.0 as well as two unique LIVE ID's with XNA Creator's club subscriptions
		are required for the networking to work.)

Please see the A&DGuide.doc for gameplay instructions/features.
