~bug 1

when player ends turn during their move phase when using a champion with the 'E' key,
they cannot perform any spells during their attack phase


~bug 2

when player enters their attack phase with a champion (provided they did not cause bug 1),
all units in range 7 light up as if they are attackable, several errors extend from this but are solved if bug 2 is fixed


~bug 3

player cannot heal freindly units, rather then healing them they are selected


~bug 4

bolts are not killing enemy units when their hp is 0
